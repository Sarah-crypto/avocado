# Avocado ncRNA analysis
In this project shall identify ncRNA's in the Avocado genome two phases;
(i) Genome-wide identification of ncRNA genes in the draft Avocado genome using in silico approaches
(ii) Sequencing of small RNA's durinng Avocado infection by the oomyecete pathogen Phytopthora Cinnamomi
