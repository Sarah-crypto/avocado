# Avocado ncRNA analysis
This project shall identify ncRNA's in the Avocado genome in two phases;
(i) Genome-wide identification of ncRNA genes in the draft Avocado genome using in silico approaches.
(ii) Sequencing of small RNA's durinng Avocado infection by the oomycete pathogen Phytopthora Cinnamomi.
